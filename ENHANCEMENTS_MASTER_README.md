# Thespian Framework Enhancements

This document provides an overview of the major enhancements implemented for the Thespian framework to address the identified limitations in storytelling, character development, and narrative structure.

## Enhancement Systems

We've implemented three core enhancement systems that work together to create more sophisticated, detailed, and coherent theatrical productions:

1. **Iterative Refinement System**
2. **Memory and Continuity System**
3. **Advanced Story Structure System**

These systems can be used independently or combined for maximum effect. The enhancements directly address the core limitations identified in the initial framework analysis.

## 1. Iterative Refinement System

### Purpose
Enhances scene quality and depth through multiple refinement passes, focusing on specific areas that need improvement while maintaining the scene's original intent.

### Key Components
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Improved prompt templates in `enhanced_prompts.py` that emphasize detail, character depth, and sensory immersion
- **Iterative Refinement Engine**: Core refinement system in `iterative_refinement.py` for improving scenes through multiple passes
- **Enhanced Playwright**: Extended base playwright in `enhanced_playwright.py` with refinement capabilities

### Benefits
- Increases scene detail and complexity
- Improves character dialogue and psychology
- Adds sensory detail and emotional depth
- Addresses quality issues before final output

### Documentation
See [ENHANCEMENTS_README.md](ENHANCEMENTS_README.md) for detailed documentation.

## 2. Memory and Continuity System

### Purpose
Enables consistent character development and narrative continuity across scenes, with sophisticated tracking of character evolution, relationships, and plot elements.

### Key Components
- **Enhanced Memory System**: Comprehensive memory system in `enhanced_memory.py` with extensive tracking capabilities
- **Character Analyzer**: Monitoring system in `character_analyzer.py` for detecting and tracking character development
- **Memory-Enhanced Playwright**: Integration in `memory_enhanced_playwright.py` connecting memory to scene generation

### Benefits
- Ensures consistent character psychology across scenes
- Tracks character development, emotions, and relationships
- Maintains narrative threads and plot continuity
- Enables character-focused scene generation

### Documentation
See [MEMORY_ENHANCEMENTS_README.md](MEMORY_ENHANCEMENTS_README.md) for detailed documentation.

## 3. Advanced Story Structure System

### Purpose
Enables complex narrative structures beyond the standard three-act format, allowing for more sophisticated storytelling patterns like non-linear, parallel, or nested structures.

### Key Components
- **Advanced Story Planner**: Core planner in `advanced_story_structure.py` for defining complex narrative structures
- **Dynamic Scene Planner**: Adaptive scene planner that creates requirements based on narrative position
- **Structure-Enhanced Playwright**: Specialized playwright that incorporates structural elements into generation

### Benefits
- Supports multiple narrative structures (linear, non-linear, parallel, nested, etc.)
- Enables various act structure patterns (3-act, 5-act, hero's journey, etc.)
- Provides story beat tracking and management
- Coordinates plot threads, subplots, and reversals

### Documentation
See [ADVANCED_STRUCTURE_README.md](ADVANCED_STRUCTURE_README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Combined Enhancements

For maximum impact, all three systems can be combined to create extraordinarily sophisticated theatrical productions:

### Combined Approach
1. Generate an initial scene with advanced structure awareness
2. Refine the scene iteratively for quality and detail
3. Update memory and narrative continuity based on the refined scene

### Implementation
See `examples/combined_enhancements_example.py` for a complete implementation that integrates all enhancement systems.

### Benefits of Combined Approach
- **Sophisticated Narrative Structure**: Complex non-linear or nested narratives
- **Consistent Character Development**: Psychological depth that evolves naturally
- **High-Quality Scene Generation**: Multiple refinement passes for optimal output
- **Narrative Cohesion**: Connected plot elements across complex structures
- **Thematic Consistency**: Maintained themes across different narrative threads

## Example Files

Several example files demonstrate how to use each enhancement:

- `examples/enhanced_scene_generation.py`: Demonstrates iterative refinement
- `examples/memory_enhanced_generation.py`: Shows memory-enhanced generation
- `examples/advanced_story_structure_demo.py`: Showcases advanced structures
- `examples/combined_enhancements_example.py`: Integrates all systems
- `examples/compare_playwright_versions.py`: Compares base vs. enhanced versions

## Using the Enhancements

### Basic Usage

```python
# Iterative Refinement
from thespian.llm.iterative_refinement import refine_scene_iteratively

refined_scene = refine_scene_iteratively(
    scene_content=original_scene,
    context=scene_context,
    llm_invoke_func=llm.invoke,
    iterations=3,
    focus_areas=["character_depth", "sensory_detail", "dialogue_quality"]
)

# Memory System
from thespian.llm.enhanced_memory import EnhancedTheatricalMemory
from thespian.llm.memory_enhanced_playwright import MemoryEnhancedPlaywright

memory = EnhancedTheatricalMemory()
memory_playwright = MemoryEnhancedPlaywright(
    memory=memory,
    llm_invoke_func=llm.invoke
)

scene = memory_playwright.generate_scene_with_memory(
    act_number=1,
    scene_number=2,
    requirements={"setting": "castle", "tone": "mysterious"}
)

# Advanced Structure
from thespian.llm.advanced_story_structure import AdvancedStoryPlanner, DynamicScenePlanner

story_planner = AdvancedStoryPlanner(
    structure_type="non_linear",
    act_structure="hero_journey",
    num_acts=3,
    narrative_complexity="complex"
)

scene_planner = DynamicScenePlanner(
    story_planner=story_planner,
    memory=memory
)
```

### Combined Usage

```python
# Create components
memory = EnhancedTheatricalMemory()
story_planner = AdvancedStoryPlanner(...)
scene_planner = DynamicScenePlanner(...)

# Combined approach
combined_playwright = CombinedEnhancementPlaywright(
    memory=memory,
    story_planner=story_planner,
    scene_planner=scene_planner,
    llm_manager=llm_manager
)

# Generate scene with all enhancements
scene = combined_playwright.generate_refined_structured_scene(
    act_number=1,
    scene_number=2,
    additional_requirements={"setting": "forest", "tone": "mysterious"},
    refinement_iterations=3
)
```
