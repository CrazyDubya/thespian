# Thespian IDE Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan for exploring and integrating the experimental IDE components into the Thespian framework.

## Overview

The Thespian IDE components provide a set of interactive tools for theatrical production development and management. These components are currently in an experimental state and need further development and integration with the core framework.

## Component Descriptions

### 1. ScriptEditor
A collaborative script editor with version control and agent-assisted editing.
- Version tracking
- Collaborative editing
- Agent integration for feedback
- Diff and comparison features

### 2. RehearsalSandbox
An environment for testing and iterating on scenes.
- Scene rehearsal management
- Real-time feedback
- Performance simulation

### 3. PerformanceDashboard
Analytics and metrics tracking for productions.
- Performance metrics visualization
- Quality analytics
- Resource utilization tracking

### 4. AgentVisualizer
Visualization tools for agent interactions.
- Agent relationship mapping
- Decision process visualization
- Interaction debugging

### 5. PromptManager
Management and optimization of prompts.
- Template management
- A/B testing
- Performance tracking

## Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Evaluation and Planning (2-4 weeks)
1. **Assessment**
   - Review current implementation of each component
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Document required changes for core integration

2. **Prototype Development**
   - Create minimal working examples for each component
   - Build simple integrations with core systems
   - Test basic functionality

3. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Define specific use cases for each component
   - Document technical requirements
   - Establish success criteria

### Phase 2: Core Integration Development (4-8 weeks)
1. **Infrastructure Preparation**
   - Develop necessary APIs in core components
   - Create event systems for IDE-core communication
   - Implement state management for UI components

2. **Component Adaptation**
   - Refactor components to work with core systems
   - Implement missing functionality
   - Create proper dependency management

3. **Initial Integration**
   - Connect components to core system events
   - Implement data flow between systems
   - Create unified state management

### Phase 3: UI and Experience Development (4-6 weeks)
1. **User Interface Development**
   - Design consistent UI across components
   - Implement responsive design principles
   - Create accessible interactions

2. **Workflow Integration**
   - Develop unified workflow between components
   - Create seamless transitions
   - Implement session management

3. **Testing and Iteration**
   - User testing of integrated components
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixing and refinement

### Phase 4: Final Integration and Release (2-4 weeks)
1. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive user documentation
   - Develop technical API documentation
   - Create example projects and tutorials

2. **Final Testing**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Security review

3. **Release Preparation**
   - Version finalization
   - Release notes
   - Deployment strategy

## Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. ScriptEditor - Essential for core workflow
2. RehearsalSandbox - Key for iteration and development

### Medium Priority
1. PromptManager - Important for optimizing results
2. PerformanceDashboard - Valuable for analysis

### Lower Priority
1. AgentVisualizer - Helpful but more complex to implement

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
- Consider web-based UI (React, Vue, or Flask with templates)
- Implement real-time collaboration features
- Design for cross-platform compatibility

### Backend Requirements
- Create proper API endpoints for all services
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Develop proper authentication and permissions

### Integration Requirements
- Create proper event system
- Implement consistent state management
- Develop robust error handling

## Next Steps

1. Form a small team to evaluate current code
2. Develop proof-of-concept integrations
3. Create detailed technical specifications
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Conclusion

The IDE components represent a significant enhancement to the Thespian framework, providing intuitive tools for theatrical production development. With careful planning and phased implementation, these components can be successfully integrated into the core framework, creating a comprehensive development environment for AI-driven theatrical production.
