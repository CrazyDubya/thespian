[The scene opens in a high-tech laboratory with glowing holographic displays and softly humming equipment. DR. SARAH CHEN works intently at a terminal while DR. JAMES TANAKA reviews data on a floating screen. The AI ASSISTANT's voice comes from speakers throughout the room.]

DR. SARAH CHEN: (focused, typing rapidly) The quantum signature is unlike anything we've ever seen before. The entanglement patterns suggest a temporal component.

DR. JAMES TANAKA: (skeptical, adjusting glasses) That's theoretically impossible, Sarah. Quantum entanglement across time violates causality principles.

AI ASSISTANT: (neutral, analytical) Analysis complete, Doctor Chen. The data shows a 99.7% probability of temporal quantum correlation. This matches your hypothesis.

DR. SARAH CHEN: (excitedly) You see, James? The AI confirms it! We're looking at particles that appear to be entangled not just across space but across time itself.

DR. JAMES TANAKA: (moving to another display, concerned) If this gets into corporate hands before we understand the implications... there are serious ethical considerations.

[The lights briefly flicker. A low rumble is heard.]

AI ASSISTANT: (alert) Warning. Unexpected power fluctuation detected in the quantum containment field.

DR. SARAH CHEN: (alarmed) That shouldn't be possible with our safeguards! AI, run diagnostics immediately.

DR. JAMES TANAKA: (moving quickly to a control panel) I'm stabilizing the field. But look at these readingsâ€”the temporal signature is amplifying itself.

[The holographic displays flash with complex data patterns. The rumbling increases.]

DR. SARAH CHEN: (realizing) My god, James. It's not just that the particles are entangled across time. I think they're actually creating a feedback loop with their future states.

DR. JAMES TANAKA: (with dawning understanding) A temporal recursive entanglement? That would mean...

AI ASSISTANT: (urgent) Critical anomaly detected. Recommend immediate containment protocols.

[A bright flash of blue light erupts from the main quantum chamber, briefly engulfing the room, then subsiding.]

DR. SARAH CHEN: (shaken, looking at new data streaming in) The data... it's changing. I think we just witnessed the first documented case of quantum-temporal interaction.

DR. JAMES TANAKA: (solemn) We need to secure this lab immediately. And carefully consider what we do with this discovery.

AI ASSISTANT: (thoughtful) I am detecting patterns in the quantum flux that suggest deliberate organization. This may not be merely a natural phenomenon.

[The scientists exchange worried glances as the lights continue to flicker slightly.]

DR. SARAH CHEN: (quietly) What have we discovered?
