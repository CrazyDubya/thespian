Ultra-Deep Quantum Narrative Demo - Full Production Exploration

This demo pushes the quantum narrative framework to its absolute limits by:
- Generating MULTIPLE complete scenes across the entire story arc
- Ultra-deep branch exploration (10+ depth, 20+ breadth)
- Extended runtime targeting 10+ minutes of computation
- Rich multi-dimensional character psychology exploration
- Complex thematic and narrative structure analysis
- Full production pipeline with all expert agents
- Cross-scene quantum entanglement and narrative consistency
- Dynamic story evolution based on quantum exploration results

This represents the ultimate test of quantum narrative capabilities.

            When Maya was 14, her mother developed lung cancer, possibly from years of exposure to industrial pollution in their low-income neighborhood near the chemical plants.

            Maya's father retreated into grief and disappointment - his daughter chose environmental activism over the stable engineering career he'd dreamed for her. Their relationship remains strained, with Wei-Chen seeing Maya's activism as naive idealism that dishonors her mother's sacrifices for 'practical' success.
