Deep Quantum Narrative Demo - Multi-Agent Collaborative Exploration

This demo showcases the full power of quantum narrative generation by utilizing
ALL expert agents from the original framework to explore multiple dimensional
branches of story possibilities before collapsing to the optimal path.

Features:
- Multi-agent collaborative branch exploration
- Character psychology deep-dive analysis
- Narrative structure expert guidance  
- Dialogue quality assessment
- Thematic coherence evaluation
- Scenic composition analysis
- Pacing and rhythm optimization
- Real-time quantum state visualization
