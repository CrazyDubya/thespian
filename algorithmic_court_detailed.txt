SCRIPT REVISIONS:

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:

Solomon: To make Solomon's transformation more gradual, we'll add scenes where the AI starts to question its own logic and decisions. For example, after the first court hearing, we could add a scene where Solomon reviews its own decisions, signaling the beginning of its transformation.

Alice: Expanding Alice's role, we can add a subplot where Alice investigates the corruption within the justice system alongside John. This would give us more opportunities to see her character in action and contribute to the plot.

Corrupt Official: To heighten the sense of danger and corruption, we will include more dialogue and actions that reveal the Corrupt Official's influence and threat. His name will remain undisclosed, but his presence will be more palpable via his impact on the other characters and the storyline.

DIALOGUE:

John's dialogue will be made more nuanced. Instead of, "I created you, Solomon. I know I'm innocent!" and "Justice prevails!", he could say, "Solomon, your code is based on my ethics, can't you see my innocence?" and "No system is above justice!"

PLOT:

To add more conflict, we could introduce a subplot where John has to protect Alice from the Corrupt Official while trying to prove his innocence. This would also give Alice a more active role in the story.

Final Scene: The climax can be heightened by Solomon's unexpected decision to put itself on trial for its initial judgement of John. This would reflect its character development and the script's theme of AI and justice.

TECHNOLOGY:

The use of holographic projections to represent Solomon's code and digital evidence will be retained as it's innovative and visually appealing.

SETTING:

The contrasting settings and atmospheres between John's apartment and the courtroom will be preserved to maintain the vivid dystopian world.

CHARACTERS:

John Cipher's character transition will be maintained as it is compelling and satisfying. His journey from a confident programmer to a desperate defendant, and finally a triumphant hero, is central to the narrative.
