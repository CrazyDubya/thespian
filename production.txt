Theme: A new retelling of Romeo and Juliet
Status: characters_updated

Script:
Based on the feedback, the revised script is as follows:

Act 1, Scene 1

(Enter ROMEO and MERCUTIO, in the modern city square, alive with the hum of technology.)

ROMEO: (Sighing heavily while scrolling through his phone) Oh, Mercutio, what a heavy burden love can be.

MERCUTIO: (Chuckling) Love, Romeo? Or is it your phone that holds you captive?

ROMEO: (Smiling) Perhaps both. For my heart is captured in this device.

(Note: Let Mercutio's reaction be bemused yet concerned, revealing his unclear stance on the technology versus nature debate.)

Act 2, Scene 1

(Enter JULIET, in her room that combines both modern and old-world elements.)

JULIET: (To herself, holding a digital tablet) Romeo, Romeo. Why must you be Romeo? My heart yearns, yet my family's loyalty pulls me back.

(Note: Her struggle should be more evident, the emotional turmoil she goes through. Her facial expressions should reflect the same.)

Act 3, Scene 1

(Enter ROMEO, JULIET and MERCUTIO. The stage is divided into two parts, representing the old and the new world.)

MERCUTIO: (To Romeo, with more intensity) You court danger, my friend, with your love for her. What price are you willing to pay?

(Note: Develop Mercutio's character further here, showing his loyalty and concern for Romeo.)

Act 4, Scene 1

(Enter ROMEO and JULIET. The setting is a blend of nature and technology.)

ROMEO: (To Juliet) Our love, like this world, is a blend of old and new. Yet, it remains pure and true.

JULIET: (To Romeo, with tears in her eyes) But at what cost, Romeo? At what cost?

(Note: The setting and dialogue should intensify the conflict between the characters' love and their loyalties.)

Act 5, Scene 1

(Enter ROMEO, JULIET, and MERCUTIO. The setting is the climax of the blend between the old world and the new.)

ROMEO: (Shocked, holding an old-fashioned letter) Juliet, our families have decided to unite, to merge their tech empires. We are no longer star-crossed, but the future of our world.

(Note: This unexpected twist in the story should be a big reveal, showing the audience that the narrative was not as they expected.)

JULIET: (To Romeo, with a mix of joy and fear) Oh Romeo, what shall we do?

(Note: The script ends here, leaving the audience to ponder the characters' next course of action, making the narrative more engaging.)

Set Design:

Act 1, Scene 1 should be set in an ultramodern city square, complete with LED screens and neon lights. The ground should be tiled like a chessboard, reflecting the black and white contrast of old and new. 

Act 2, Scene 1 should take place in Juliet's room, a mix of modern and old-world elements. Contemporary furniture, such as a sleek desk with a digital tablet, should be juxtaposed with an antique four-poster bed and an old-world chandelier. 

Act 3, Scene 1 should split the stage into two halves. One half should be overflowing with greenery, a tree, and a stone bench, representing the old world. The other half should capture the essence of modern technology, with a digital cityscape backdrop and touch screen panels.

Act 4, Scene 1 should blend nature and technology seamlessly. A tree with LED lights integrated into the branches, a fountain with a holographic display, and a backdrop alternating between natural and urban imagery should be used.

Act 5, Scene 1 should showcase the climax of the blend between the old and new. This could include a grand staircase with LED light strips along the steps, a backdrop of a futuristic city, and an antique table with a high-tech holographic projector.

Costume Design:

For Romeo and Mercutio, their costumes should reflect their modern environment. They should wear smart casual attire, with Romeo in a fitted shirt, jeans, and a 3D printed necklace symbolizing his family's tech empire. Mercutio, a bit more flamboyant, should be in a colorful sweater, skinny jeans, and hi-tech sneakers.

Juliet's costume should mirror her mixed environment. She should wear a modern dress made from traditional fabrics featuring digital prints. She should also have a smartwatch, symbolizing her connection to the tech world.

In Act 3, Scene 1, Romeo and Juliet should wear costumes that blend old and new. Juliet could wear a traditional ball gown made from iridescent, futuristic materials. Romeo could wear a suit with an LED tie, symbolizing his struggle between tradition and progress.

In Act 5, Scene 1, the costumes should reflect the climactic union of both worlds. Juliet could wear a modern wedding dress with integrated LED lights, and Romeo could wear a traditional tuxedo with a digital pocket watch.
