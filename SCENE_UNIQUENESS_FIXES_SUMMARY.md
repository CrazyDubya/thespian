# Scene Uniqueness Fixes Summary

## Problem Identification
The comprehensive example was generating only 3 unique scenes repeated across 15 scenes instead of 15 unique scenes with proper story progression. Analysis revealed:

1. **Scene Generation Pipeline Failure**: All generation methods used the same core logic without sufficient differentiation
2. **Missing Uniqueness Validation**: No validation to prevent duplicate scene content
3. **Insufficient Prompt Specificity**: Prompts didn't include enough context to ensure unique content
4. **Generation Type Differentiation Failure**: Different generation approaches produced similar output
5. **Memory Context Not Applied**: Memory system wasn't properly integrated into scene generation

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Scene Uniqueness Validation and Retry Logic (P0 Critical)
**Files Modified**: `thespian/llm/consolidated_playwright.py`

- **Added `_get_all_previous_scenes()`**: Retrieves all previously generated scenes from run manager
- **Added `_validate_scene_uniqueness()`**: Implements Jaccard similarity comparison (threshold: 0.6)
- **Enhanced `_generate_initial_scene()`**: Added retry logic with max 3 attempts for unique scene generation
- **Retry Mechanism**: If scene similarity detected, adds feedback and regenerates with uniqueness constraint

```python
def _validate_scene_uniqueness(self, new_scene: str, previous_scenes: List[str], similarity_threshold: float = 0.6) -> bool:
    # Jaccard similarity comparison on first 10 lines
    # Returns False if similarity > 0.6, triggering retry
```

### 2. Enhanced Scene Prompt Specificity (P0 Critical)
**Files Modified**: 
- `thespian/llm/consolidated_playwright.py`
- `thespian/config/prompts.py`
- `thespian/config/enhanced_prompts.py`

- **Added `_build_uniqueness_constraint()`**: Creates explicit uniqueness requirements in prompts
- **Added `_build_scene_specific_directive()`**: Provides scene-specific dramatic progression guidance
- **Enhanced Prompt Templates**: Added `{uniqueness_constraint}` and `{scene_directive}` placeholders
- **Scene-Specific Directives**: Each act/scene combination gets specific dramatic purpose

Example uniqueness constraint:
```
CRITICAL UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT:
This scene MUST be completely different from all previous scenes.
DO NOT repeat any of these previous scene patterns:
Previous scene 1: [SETTING: Lab] DR. SMITH: The results are...
This is Act 2, Scene 3. Generate a UNIQUE scene that advances the story in a NEW way.
```

### 3. Proper Generation Type Differentiation (P1 High)
**Files Modified**: 
- `thespian/llm/consolidated_playwright.py`
- `comprehensive_example.py`

- **Added `generation_type` parameter**: All generation methods now accept and pass generation type
- **Added `_get_generation_type_directive()`**: Provides type-specific generation instructions
- **Enhanced Method Signatures**: Updated `generate_scene()`, `collaborate_on_scene()`, `create_scene_with_character_focus()`
- **Type-Specific Instructions**: Each generation type gets distinct creative direction

Generation type directives:
- **basic**: "Focus on clear, straightforward narrative progression with strong dialogue and action."
- **collaborative**: "Emphasize dynamic character interactions and layered dialogue that reveals multiple perspectives."
- **character_focused**: "Prioritize deep character development, internal monologue, and character-driven conflict."
- **memory_enhanced**: "Incorporate rich continuity details, character history callbacks, and plot thread connections."
- **iterative_refinement**: "Create sophisticated, nuanced scenes with complex subtext and artistic flourishes."

### 4. Memory Context Integration (P1 High)
**Files Modified**: `thespian/llm/consolidated_playwright.py`

- **Enhanced `_construct_scene_prompt()`**: Memory context automatically included when capability enabled
- **Memory Context Formatting**: JSON-formatted memory data added to prompts
- **Character Continuity**: Character states and development arcs integrated into scene requirements
- **Plot Thread Tracking**: Unresolved plots and foreshadowing elements included in generation directives

## Scene-Specific Dramatic Progression

Each scene now receives specific dramatic purpose guidance:

### Act 1
- Scene 1: "OPENING SCENE: Establish the world, introduce main characters, set the premise"
- Scene 2: "INCITING INCIDENT: Introduce the central conflict or challenge"
- Scene 3: "FIRST PLOT POINT: Deepen the conflict, reveal character motivations"
- Scene 4: "RISING ACTION: Escalate tensions, introduce complications"
- Scene 5: "ACT ONE CLIMAX: Major revelation or turning point that propels us into Act 2"

### Act 2
- Scene 1: "NEW CIRCUMSTANCES: Characters adapt to changed situation from Act 1"
- Scene 2: "MIDPOINT BUILD: Increasing pressure and stakes"
- Scene 3: "MIDPOINT: Major reversal, revelation, or point of no return"
- Scene 4: "CRISIS ESCALATION: Everything falls apart, lowest point"
- Scene 5: "SECOND PLOT POINT: Final push toward resolution, characters commit to final action"

### Act 3
- Scene 1: "FINAL BATTLE: Climactic confrontation begins"
- Scene 2: "CLIMAX: Peak of dramatic tension and conflict"
- Scene 3: "FALLING ACTION: Immediate consequences of climax"
- Scene 4: "RESOLUTION: Tying up loose ends, character arcs conclude"
- Scene 5: "DENOUEMENT: Final state, new equilibrium, thematic statement"

## Technical Implementation Details

### Retry Logic Flow
1. Generate scene with enhanced prompt (includes uniqueness constraint)
2. Validate uniqueness against previous scenes
3. If similar (Jaccard similarity > 0.6), add retry feedback and regenerate
4. Maximum 3 attempts before accepting scene (with warning)
5. Track attempt count in timing metrics

### Prompt Enhancement Flow
1. Retrieve all previous scenes from run manager
2. Build uniqueness constraint with scene summaries
3. Build scene-specific directive based on act/scene position
4. Build generation-type directive based on method called
5. Integrate memory context if enabled
6. Format all enhancements into prompt template

### Generation Type Flow
1. Method caller sets `generation_type` parameter
2. `generate_scene()` stores type in `self._current_generation_type`
3. Prompt construction includes type-specific directive
4. Enhanced prompts guide LLM toward type-appropriate output

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the system should now:

1. **Generate 15 Unique Scenes**: Each scene validated for uniqueness with retry mechanism
2. **Proper Story Progression**: Scene-specific directives ensure dramatic arc progression
3. **Differentiated Generation Types**: Each scene number uses distinct generation approach
4. **Rich Memory Integration**: Character and plot continuity maintained across scenes
5. **Enhanced Quality**: More specific prompts lead to more targeted, appropriate scene content

## Testing

Validated core logic with `test_simple_uniqueness.py`:
- ✅ Uniqueness validation algorithm
- ✅ Constraint building logic  
- ✅ Generation type directives
- ✅ Scene-specific dramatic guidance

## Next Steps

The fixes are complete and ready for production testing with the comprehensive example to verify 15 unique scenes with proper story progression.
